1. In Python, the in operator is used to check if a value exists in a list or string.

2. The numpy module is commonly used for numerical computations in Python.

3. To import a module named math, you use the statement import math.

4. To convert a string to an integer in Python, you use the function int().

5. In Python, a dictionary is defined using curly braces, like this:
my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

7. The input() function is used to read a line of text from user input.

8. In Python, the None keyword is used to indicate that a function does not return any value.

9. To combine two strings str1 and str2, you use the + operator.
